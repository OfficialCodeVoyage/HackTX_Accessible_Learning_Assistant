Linear Algebra 
A gentle introduction
Linear Algebra has become as basic and as applicable 
as calculus, and fortunately it is easier.

What is a Vector ?
Think of a vector as a directed line 
segment in N -dimensions ! (has “length” 
and “direction”)
Basic idea: convert geometry in higher 
dimensions into algebra!
Once you define a “nice” basis along 
each dimension: x -, y-, z-axis …  
Vector becomes a N x 1 matrix!
v= [a  b  c]T
Geometry starts to become linear 
algebra on vectors like v!

Change only the length (“scaling”), but keep direction fixed .
Sneak peek: matrix operation ( Av) can change length, 
direction and also dimensionality !

Think of the dot product as 
a matrix multiplication
The magnitude is the dot 
product of a vector with itself
The dot product is also related to the 
angle between the two vectors

Bases & Orthonormal Bases
Basis (or axes): frame of reference
vs
Basis: a space is totally defined by a set of vectors –any point is a linear 
combination of the basis
Ortho -Normal: orthogonal + normal
[Sneak peek : 
Orthogonal : dot product is zero
Normal : magnitude is one ]

Multiplication
Is AB = BA?  Maybe, but maybe not!
Matrix multiplication AB: apply transformation B first, and 
then again transform using A!
Heads up: multiplication is NOT commutative!
Note : If A and B both represent either pure “ rotation ” or 
“scaling ” they can be interchanged (i.e. AB = BA)

Inverse of a Matrix
Identity matrix: 
AI = A
Inverse exists only for square 
matrices that are non-singular
Maps N -d space to another 
N-d space bijectively
Some matrices have an 
inverse, such that:
AA-1= I
Inversion is tricky:
(ABC)-1= C-1B-1A-1
Derived from non -
commutativity property
