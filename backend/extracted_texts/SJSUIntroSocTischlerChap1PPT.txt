organism.

specialized contributions, the various 
segments of society are interdependent.

“survival of the fittest” to society.

relatively coherent discipline:

Karl Marx (1818 –1883)
▪Believed the history of human societies 
could be seen as the history of class 
conflict between:

the means of production.

of workers.

Émile Durkheim (1858 –1917)
▪Believed individuals were the products of 
their social environment.
▪Society shapes people in every possible 
way.
▪Showed how a personal act, suicide, is 
patterned by social factors.

Durkheim’s Three Types of 
Suicide
▪Egoistic suicide -derives from loneliness 
and a commitment to personal beliefs 
over group values.
▪Altruistic suicide -the individual is willing 
to die for the sake of the community.
▪Anomic suicide -results from feeling 
disconnected from society’s values.

Suicide in the United States
▪Social factors:
▪Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of 
death for 15 -to 24 -year-olds. 
▪Older adults account for 20% of suicide 
deaths, but only 13% of the U.S. 
population.
▪Suicide rates for Native Americans are
